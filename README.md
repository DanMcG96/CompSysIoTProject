# IoT GreenHouse Monitor
 A homemade DIY project from monitoring a greenhouse for SETU Computer Systems and Networks Module assignment 2.

## What it is
This project is designed to use a number of different IoT devices to basically moniter conditions in a greenhouse and then to send notifications to the user in the case of certian predetermined events. The project is ran from a raspberry pi 4 and was designed using python as the coding language. There is also a rudimentary website that displays data taken from the raspberry pi about the current temperature, pressure and humidity conditions in the greenhouse; as well as a picture of the inside of the greenhouse that is updated daily. (Although feel free to employ a more frequent schedule if you wish). Pictures are stored on FireBase.
