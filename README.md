# IoT GreenHouse Monitor
 A homemade DIY project from monitoring a greenhouse for SETU Computer Systems and Networks Module assignment 2.

## What is it?
This project is designed to use a number of different IoT devices to basically moniter conditions in a greenhouse and then to send notifications to the user in the case of certian predetermined events. The project is ran from a raspberry pi 4 and was designed using python as the coding language. There is also a rudimentary website that displays data taken from the raspberry pi about the current temperature, pressure and humidity conditions in the greenhouse; as well as a picture of the inside of the greenhouse that is updated daily. (Although feel free to employ a more frequent schedule if you wish). Pictures are stored on FireBase.

## Pre-requisites?
In order to get started with this project you'll need:

The Hardware: 

* Raspberry Pi (I use a Pi 4 Model B) but I'm fairly sure a Pi 3 should be fine
* Raspberry Camera Module V2 (Again different pi cameras should be fine)
* PIR motion sensor (NB: Make sure it's one that can be easily connected to GPIO board)
* Fly Cables
* Raspberry Pi SenseHat
* Smart Light (I use a WiX smart bulb, but you can go for a Philips Hue if you're feeling fancy)
* Bluetooth Speaker

The Software:

* Raspbian OS (I use headless and connect over ssh but GUI is fine too)
* IFTTT (https://ifttt.com)
* ThingSpeak (https://thingspeak.com)
* FireBase (https://firebase.google.com)
* Blynk (https://blynk.io)

### The Speaker

## The Setup
 
This tutorial assumes you already have a Raspberry Pi setup. If not here is a useful video for setting up your raspberry Pi [Tom's Hardware] (https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/set-up-raspberry-pi) 

#### Step 1: Attach the Camera module to the raspberry pi as shown. NB: Be sure to put the camera cable through the sensehat before connecting it to the pi as trying to attach the camera with the sensehat already on the pi is next to impossible.
