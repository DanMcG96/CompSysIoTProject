# IoT GreenHouse Monitor
 A homemade DIY project from monitoring a greenhouse for SETU Computer Systems and Networks Module assignment 2.

## What is it?
This project is designed to use a number of different IoT devices to basically moniter conditions in a greenhouse and then to send notifications to the user in the case of certian predetermined events. The project is ran from a raspberry pi 4 and was designed using python as the coding language. There is also a rudimentary website that displays data taken from the raspberry pi about the current temperature, pressure and humidity conditions in the greenhouse; as well as a picture of the inside of the greenhouse that is updated daily. (Although feel free to employ a more frequent schedule if you wish). Pictures are stored on FireBase.

### The Website: (https://pineapple-rambunctious-sauroposeidon.glitch.me) 

## Pre-requisites?
In order to get started with this project you'll need:

The Hardware: 

* Raspberry Pi (I use a Pi 4 Model B) but I'm fairly sure a Pi 3 should be fine
* Raspberry Camera Module V2 (Again different pi cameras should be fine)
* PIR motion sensor (NB: Make sure it's one that can be easily connected to GPIO board)
* Fly Cables
* Raspberry Pi SenseHat
* Smart Light (I use a WiX smart bulb, but you can go for a Philips Hue if you're feeling fancy)
* Bluetooth Speaker

The Software:

* Raspbian OS (I use headless and connect over ssh but GUI is fine too)
* IFTTT (https://ifttt.com)
* ThingSpeak (https://thingspeak.com)
* FireBase (https://firebase.google.com)
* Blynk (https://blynk.io)

### The Speaker

## The Setup
 
This tutorial assumes you already have a Raspberry Pi setup. If not here is a useful video for setting up your raspberry Pi [Tom's Hardware] (https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/set-up-raspberry-pi) 

#### Step 1: Attach the Camera module to the raspberry pi as shown. NB: Be sure to put the camera cable through the sensehat before connecting it to the pi as trying to attach the camera with the sensehat already on the pi is next to impossible.

### Step 2:

Connect the PIR Sensor to the PI as shown. Ideally you would use a pin extender to attach the PIR sensor on top of the SenseHat but since I don't have an extender I had to improvise.
 
*Connect the VCC pin on the PIR to Pin 2 on the Pi
*Connect the OUT pin on the PIR to Pin 6 on the Pi
*Connect the GROUND pin on the PIR to pin 12 on the Pi

### Step 3:

Attach the SenseHat to the Pi as shown

That's the Pi setup complete. üëç

## The External Hardware

### Connecting your bluetooth speaker.

#### The following step requires that you know the bluetooth name of your speaker or its MAC address

Connecting your speaker to your raspberry pi requires a few commands to be entered into the command line. Luckily though, when you have the speaker connected to the pi it should automatically reconnect whenever you need. 

To find your speaker enter the following commands :
* $bluetoothctl
* $power on
* $agent on
* $scan on

You should see a list begin to populate with different MAC addresses. Look for the one that corresponds to your bluetooth speaker and take note of its MAC address

To connect your speaker:
* $pair <SPEAKER_MAC_ADDRESS>
* $trust <SPEAKER_MAC_ADDRESS>

You can check if the speaker is paired by typing:
* $paired-devices

The bluetooth speaker should now be connected üëç

###  Setting up your Smart Light

This project uses a WiZ smart bulb to communicate with IFTTT and listen for certain events. Such as if the humidity in the area as risen above a certain point. I used WiZ for the this project as they are much more affordable than Philips Hue but it's up to you. The bulbs I used can be found here: (https://www.harveynorman.ie/computing/connected-home-en/all-connected-home/wiz-a60-e27-standard-full-colour-smart-bulbs-with-wizmote-2-piece-of-pack.html) The biggest advantage of WiZ is that you don't need to purchase a bridge to make them work. 

* Download the WiZ app from either the App Store of Google 
* Make sure lights can talk to IFTTT by going to Settings --> Integrations --> IFTTT and enabling IFTTT

Your smart bulb is ready to go üëç

###  IFTTT

This project uses a number of IFTTT applets to fire events based on triggers

![Screenshot 2022-12-23 at 03 39 32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97414396/209266464-34a8a2bb-69ea-45c2-b2b3-827619301448.jpg)

* The first applet turns the WiZ light blue if the humidity rises above 85% in your local area
* The second applet turns the WiZ light red if the temperature rises above 21¬∞C
* The third applet sends a SMS if a WebHooks GET request is sent. (The GET request is sent based on a    condition in the python script)
* The fourth applet triggers the WiZ light to turn on from a WebHooks GET request

You can set your IFTTT applets to do basically whatever you want

## Some things to note

### SSH Broken-Pipe

Since this project runs on the pi over ssh the programs are at risk of being terminated if the current ssh session is unexpectedly disconnected (Which seems to happen more often than you'd like)

Thankfully though. There is a good solution using Screen. Screen is a useful tool in linux that allows processes to continue running on your server even if the ssh connection is dropped.

To use Screen:
* Download Screen: $ sudo apt-get install screen
* To start a new Screen session: $ screen
* Run your program
* To check what Screens you have running: $ screen -ls
* To pass into a specific Screen session: $ screen -r <ID of your screen session >

### Scheduling Functions

Linux has the crontab utility to allow you to schedule certian programs to run at specific times. However I have found crontab to be a little unreliable. Therefore I have decided to use the 'Schedule' library to schedule some of the functions in my script:

<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2022-12-23 at 04 15 30" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97414396/209269825-36ca1d0f-e240-4519-87fc-4de61be12a1d.png">

* $ pip install schedule
