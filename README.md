# IoT GreenHouse Monitor

## A homemade DIY project from monitoring a greenhouse for SETU Computer Systems and Networks Module assignment 2.


This project is designed to use a number of different IoT devices to basically moniter conditions in a greenhouse and then to send notifications to the user in the case of certian predetermined events. The project is ran from a raspberry pi 4 and was designed using python as the coding language. There is also a rudimentary website that displays data taken from the raspberry pi about the current temperature, pressure and humidity conditions in the greenhouse.
